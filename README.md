Book Collection and Reading Management System.

## Description

As I meticulously arrange my book collection, a realization dawns â€“ some titles, lent to others, have embarked on their own literary journeys. Motivated by this, I am inspired to craft a graceful library system.

Imagine a library experience where borrowing books is as simple as a tap, and discovering your next favorite read is a delightful journey. 

And also being able to easily bookmark the things you read from the app until the lines in the page using the camera
