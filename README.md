Book Management System

For private use

## Description

As I meticulously arrange my book collection, a realization dawns â€“ some titles, lent to others, have embarked on their own literary journeys. Motivated by this, I am inspired to craft a graceful library system.

## Feature

allows multiple users to log in and manage the books they borrow from each other.

User can also provide pictures for the books.

**Catalog Management:**
   - Search and browse functionality for books, categorizing by genres, authors, or subjects.
   - Real-time availability status for each book.
   - Detailed book information, including cover images and summaries.

**Check-in/Check-out System:**
   - Efficient process for borrowing and returning books.
   - Notifications for overdue items and reservation alerts.

**Reservation System:**
   - Allow users to reserve books that are currently checked out.
   - Hold a reserved book for a specified period.
